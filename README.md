Git : free and opensource Version control system

GitHub: Website where you host all of your git repositories.

Version Control: Track our code changes,basically save an initial version of our code into GIT. and then update code,we can save it into git again and again and again and throughout time as our code continues to change we can look back at all the changes we have ever made over time.This helps us to track down what we did when we did and debug the bug at the time of creation.

Commands:

1. clone: bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like github into a folder on your local machine.
2. add: track your file and changes in git.
3. commit: save your files in git.
4. push: upload git commits to a remote repo like Github.
5. pull: download changes from remote repo to your local machine the opposite of push.
